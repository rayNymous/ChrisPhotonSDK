The Recast Unity project uses Json.Net for .Net 2.0 to handle json and bson serialization. It's readme and license is included in the directory.

It also has the prebuild .dll for Recast written in C#.

The source for Recast is included in the zip as it is intended to be used as a utility for a server and needs the same .dll to ensure compatibility between the exported and imported nav mesh data files.
